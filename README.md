### Angular Projekti

---

Well, what is there to say? I don't like angular, the way it is used, and the fact that so many things are
hidden from you, the developer, and to do a simple thing, there are thousands of files installed/downloaded
by default, and that most of them are never used.

That is for starters. I could continue to list why I don't like this technology, but it is pointless, since
this is just a project for a mandatory course in my degree programme, so I'll just try to cope, and do the 
rehearsals and just get a grade from the course and then just move on to the next thing.

Maybe I'll learn something that is useful to me in the future, or maybe I just get more and more frustrated like
I have been when I've been doing these rehearsals, that have vague descriptions etc. etc.

Beyond this section starts the general yadda-yadda that angular puts to every readme.md
